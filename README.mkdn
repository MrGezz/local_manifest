Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/BeanStalk, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the BeanStalk trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/MrGezz/local_manifest.git -b beanstalk

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see any of the official beanstalk XDA threads for building instructions.

For more information on this Github Organization and how it is structured, 
please [read the wiki article](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Github_Organization)

Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built nightly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.
